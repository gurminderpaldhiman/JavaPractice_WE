Write an interest calculator program that works as described in this example:

John has $500 to invest. Sue knows of a mutual fund plan that pays 10% interest annually, compounded quarterly.
That is, every three months, the principal is multiplied by 2.5% (the 10% annual rate divided by 4 because it is compounded 4 times per year)
and the result is added to the principal.

More generally, the new amount each quarter is equal to:
CurrentBalance * (1 + (QuarterlyInterestRate / 100))

REQUIREMENTS
Make the program general; that is, it should prompt for the following inputs and use those inputs in the calculations.
-The annual interest rate
-The initial amount of principal
-The number of years the money is to stay in the fund

The output should include the following for each year:
-The year number
-The principal at the beginning of the year
-The total amount of interest earned for the year
-The principal at the end of the year

SAMPLE PROGRAM OUTPUT
How much do you want to invest? 500
How many years are investing? 10
What is the annual interest rate % growth? 10

Earned $57.30
Ended with $609.20

Year 3:
Began with $609.20
Earned $63.24
Ended with $672.44
