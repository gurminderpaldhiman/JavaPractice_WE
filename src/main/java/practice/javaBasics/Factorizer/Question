Write a program that receives an integer value from a user and then calculates and prints out a list that includes all of the factors of that number, whether or not the number is perfect, and whether or not the number is prime.

A perfect number is a number where all the factors of the number, excluding the number itself, add up to that number. For example, the first perfect number is 6 because its factors 1, 2, and 3 add up to 6.

A prime number is defined as a number greater than 1 that has only itself and 1 as factors. For example, 3 is a prime number, but 4 is not.

Sample Program Output
What number would you like to factor? 6
The factors of 6 are:
1 2 3 6
6 has 4 factors.
6 is a perfect number.
6 is not a prime number.
